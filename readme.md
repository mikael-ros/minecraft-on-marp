# Minecraft on Marp!
A yanky theme that uses Minecraft assets to create an accurate Minecraft experience.

Originally made for a Minecraft presentation I held.

## How to use
1. Download this GitHub repository, either by downloading the latest release .zip or cloning.
2. Put the CSS file somewhere appropriate, in your presentation, or if starting anew suggestively using the example files.
3. Download/extract the necessary third-party assets. See "Mining for assets"
4. Put them by the project root, according to the patterns defined in the CSS file, unless you wish to change it:
- assets/fonts
- assets/texturepack
- assets/images
